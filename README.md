# Know The Weather

I have been learning React Native for a few months and thought of implementing my newly learned knowledge. Know The Weather is a basic weather forecast app that shows the temperature and weather conditions of 5 cities (Regina, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, and Hyderabad). Know the current temperature, hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, 10-day forecast, and other weather conditions. At present all the app data is hard-coded and not actual.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a React-Native App, which can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

### Installing and running the app

1. Clone the repo
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/thehasnanialeen/KnowTheWeather.git
    cd /KnowTheWeather
    ```
2. Run either `$ yarn install` or `$ npm install`

3. With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app:

    Android: ` $ react-native run-android`

    IOS: `$ react-native run-ios`
